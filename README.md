# 🩸 Smart Hemodialysis Monitoring System

A team-based biomedical engineering project that simulates and enhances the safety of the hemodialysis process using real-time sensor-based monitoring.

##  Project Overview

This system was designed to simulate the blood filtration process used in hemodialysis while monitoring for **patient safety** using multiple sensors.  
It takes **blood** from the arm, simulates **filtration**, and then returns it — all while keeping track of critical parameters to ensure the patient's well-being during the session.

## 🔧 Features

-  **Blood Flow Simulation**: Blood is filtered and recirculated.
-  **GSR Sensor**: Monitors skin conductivity to detect patient stress or fatigue. If the patient is in distress, the system adjusts the flow rate or halts operation.
-  **Color Sensor**: Detects any **membrane rupture** in the dialyzer. If blood leaks, the dialyzer color changes and the sensor triggers an alarm + system shutdown.
-  **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Monitors the tubing system for **blockages or air bubbles** and triggers a buzzer alert if detected.
-  **Buzzer**: Gives a loud alert in case of any malfunction or emergency.
